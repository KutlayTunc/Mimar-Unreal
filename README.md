# Mimar - Mixed Reality Anatomy Learning App  

![Mimar Logo](link-to-your-logo.png)  

**Mimar** is a Mixed Reality (MR) application designed to help users explore human anatomy interactively. Built with **Unreal Engine 5.5.3** and optimized for **Meta Quest 3**, this project allows users to manipulate anatomical structures in 3D space using intuitive grab mechanics.  

## ðŸš€ Features  

- **Anatomy Exploration** ðŸ§ ðŸ’€ðŸ«€  
  - View and interact with **organs, circulatory system, skeleton, and muscles** in MR.  
  - 3D labels dynamically display the names of bones, organs, and structures.  

- **Advanced Grab System** âœ‹  
  - **One-hand grab** for picking up and inspecting objects.  
  - **Two-hand grab** to scale objects dynamically.  

- **Puzzle Mechanics** ðŸ§©  
  - Mini-games that challenge users to assemble anatomical structures.  

- **Immersive UI & Tutorial** ðŸŽ¨ðŸ“–  
  - A well-designed user interface with a tutorial to guide users.  

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used  

- **Unreal Engine 5.5.3**  
- **MetaXR & Quest 3 SDK**  

## ðŸ“Œ Development Progress  

âœ… Basic MR environment setup  
âœ… Single-hand grab system  
ðŸ”„ Two-hand grab & object scaling (Current stage)  
ðŸ”œ UI design & tutorial implementation  
ðŸ”œ Puzzle mechanics development  

## ðŸŽ¯ Vision  

"Mimar" is not just an anatomy learning app but a foundation for future projects, creating a **mixed world** where users can interact with knowledge in a new way.
